Aromas of coffee and dark chocolate come through from the use of roasted barley and chocolate malts. Smooth, dark chocolate and subtle notes of toasted coconut create a pleasant bouquet of flavors for the palate. A medium-light body that shows creaminess and low roast makes this offering approachable year round. At 6.5%, this beer is a real treat for those looking for rich, velvety smooth stout." ),

Built on the backbone of a traditional Standard Pub Ale with our own twist added, Bestie is designed to be a flavor-forward, yet easy-drinking beer. It is medium amber in color with light hints of peat and dark fruits and finishes crisp and clean with lingering floral hops.")
