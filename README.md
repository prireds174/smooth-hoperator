### Smooth Hoperator

> An app to find nearby breweries for a nice sip after. Beer section in app to list different beers from different places. Implement User feedback feature for Breweries.

### The tech stack (frontend, backend, database)

> Django app with API implementation

### List of backend models and their properties

Breweries - Name, Location, Brewery Type
Beers - Name, brand, types of beer

### User stories

> I want to find nearby breweries for a weekend getaway
> I'm at the liquor store and want to try a new beer, not picky, shoot me a random new brewski.
> Awhile back I went to a brewery and found this delicious beer I fell in love with, I don't remember the name, and I know the brewery rotates beers every month, I need to find past beers that this Brewery has created.
