### User stories

- I want to find nearby breweries for a weekend getaway
- I'm at the liquor store and want to try a new beer, not picky, shoot me a random new brewski.
- Awhile back I went to a brewery and found this delicious beer I fell in love with, I don't remember the name, and I know the brewery rotates beers every month, I need to find past beers that this Brewery has created.

## Future Implementations

- Connect beers to brewery api id.
- Update favorites cards to show more detail.
